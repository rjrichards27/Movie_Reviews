# Movie_Reviews
This repository contains code for generating seniment analysis of movie reviews. The data used to generate the solutions is in the data folder under "movies.csv". In order to use the code the following packages need to be installed: pandas, numpy, regex, sklearn.model_selection, statistics, DataLoader, TensorDataset, torch, torch.nn, CountVectorizer, TfidfVectorizer, MultinomialNB, LabelBinarizer, accuracy_score, stopwords, and random. The code for the probabilistic model, using generated data and real data, is in the file called "sentiment_analysis.ipynb". While the code for the neural networks and their given data set are in "NN2_real_data.ipynb" and "NN2_SyntheticData.ipynb". The two datasets used in the models are in the data folder.
